        Spring comes with a powerful web framework known as Spring MVC. At the center of
        Spring MVC is the concept of a controller, a class that handles requests and responds
        with information of some sort. In the case of a browser-facing application, a controller
        responds by optionally populating model data and passing the request on to a view to
        produce HTML thatâ€™s returned to the browser.

            forwards the request to the home page view without populating any model data

            The template name is derived from the logical view name by prefixing it with /templates/
            and postfixing it with .html.
